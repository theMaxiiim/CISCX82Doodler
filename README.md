# CISCX82Doodler


#### Used Compose UI as opposed to Views UI since the latter is not favored by the Android Docs.



-- Prior to building, the @OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3Api::class) experimental flag must be added to the source code (if not already there), otherwise, the top bar will fail to render

-> App can be run on Android Studio Simulator (API >= 35)



--- Primary Resources Used 
 - Android Studio Docs
 - StackOverFlow
 - [Building First App](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app#0)
